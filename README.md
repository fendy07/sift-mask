<i>The vast diversity of art in Indonesia generates many interest both domestically and internationally. One of the prominent culture is Cirebon Mask. There are five types of Cirebon masks: Panji, Samba, Rumyang, Tumenggung and Klana. In this research, Cirebon masks is classified using digital images processing techniques using Scale-Invariant Feature Transform, while K-Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Machines and Random Forest as the classifier.</i>

## Methodology 
* Data Collection
  * The dataset were collected using two different ways: captured the Cirebon mask images using camera and collected Cirebon mask images    using search engine application.
* Pre-Processing 
  * In this step, the background images were removed manually, this make the background become black. After remove the background images, each images get resize into 50 x 50 resolution.
* Feature Extraction 
  * Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) 
* Classification
  * K-Nearest Neighbor
  * Support Vector Machine
  * Random Forest
