<i>The vast diversity of art in Indonesia generates much interest both domestically and internationally. One of the prominent cultures is the Cirebon Mask. There are five types of Cirebon masks: Panji, Samba, Rumyang, Tumenggung, and Klana. In this research, Cirebon masks are classified using digital image processing techniques using Scale-Invariant Feature Transform, while K-Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest are the classifiers.</i>

## Methodology 
* Data Collection
  * The dataset was collected using two different ways: captured the Cirebon mask images using a camera and collected Cirebon mask images using a search engine application.
* Pre-Processing 
  * In this step, the background images were removed manually, this made the background black. After removing the background images, each image is resized to 50 x 50 pixel resolution.
* Feature Extraction 
  * Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) 
* Classification
  * K-Nearest Neighbor
  * Support Vector Machine
  * Random Forest
